# Intro

## Warning: This is a DRAFT, a very, very early version of the Programming Competition guideline.



A programming competition is a mind sport. Just like any other sport, it requires proper training and practice. Also, it is an effective way to be a better programmer. 



You can use Python, Java or C++ for this class. These three are the most popular languages for a programming competition.

To be good at the competition, you will need to improve the following areas:

1. Typing speed
2. Know your language better \(Python, Java, C++\)
3. Practice, practice, practice

Are you ready to begin? Great! Let's get started!
